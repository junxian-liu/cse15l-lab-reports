# Lab Report 4 - Junxian Liu
For this lab report, we'll be looking at the tasks that we did as part of a competition during our lab. These tasks required us to 
clone a repository from github account, run tests on the file, debug the files, and then commit the changes we made to github. 

### Step 4 - Log into ieng6

This task was fairly simple as it just required us to log into our ieng6 account which is something we have done many times before. 
To log in, we would type
`ssh` 
followed with our ieng6 account. Then when prompted to enter our password, we would then enter our password there. If everything is correct, 
you would get a message saying you succesffully logged into your account.
